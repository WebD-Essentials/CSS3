            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            <br>
            around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most <br>
            unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
            it,<br>
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            <br>

            have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.”
